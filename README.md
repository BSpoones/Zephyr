deletions,
message reactions, and much more!

## AutoPurge

> **NOTE:** This module is only available for servers!

The AutoPurge module is used to automatically delete messages older than a chosen timeframe. This can help declutter
channels such as bot command channels. There is an option for pinned messages to be spared.

Commands:
- [Setup](#autopurge-setup)
- [Status](#autopurge-status)
- [Edit](#autopurge-edit)
- [Toggle](#autopurge-toggle)
- [Remove](#autopurge-remove)
- [Export](#autopurge-export)
- [Import](#autopurge-import)


#### AutoPurge Setup

AutoPurge can be applied to multiple channels at the same time, meaning you have to create an AutoPurge instance for each
channel you want to use it in. To set up AutoPurge in a channel, use the AutoPurge setup command:

```
/autopurge setup <cutoff> [channel] [ignore_pinned]
```

// TODO -> IMAGE

- ðŸ“Œ Cutoff: How long should a message stay on the channel for? TODO LINK
- ðŸŸ§ Channel: Which channel should AutoPurge be setup in? This defaults to the current channel
- ðŸŸ§ Ignore_Pinned: Should AutoPurge ignore pinned messages? This defaults to true

---

#### AutoPurge Status

To retrieve the status of an AutoPurge instance, use the AutoPurge status command:

```
/autopurge status [channel]
```

- ðŸŸ§ Channel: Which channel should AutoPurge be setup in? This defaults to the current channel

TODO >> Show image of status

#### AutoPurge Edit

To edit the AutoPurge instance, use the AutoPurge edit command:

```
/autopurge edit {cutoff} {ignore_pinned}
```

- ðŸŸ§ Cutoff: How long should a message stay on the channel for? TODO LINK
- ðŸŸ§ Ignore_Pinned: Should AutoPurge ignore pinned messages? This defaults to true

---

#### AutoPurge Toggle

If AutoPurge needs to be disabled for a while, or re-enabled after disabling, use the AutoPurge toggle command

```
/autopurge toggle [channel]
```

- ðŸŸ§ Channel: Which channel should AutoPurge be toggled in? This defaults to the current channel

#### AutoPurge Remove

If AutoPurge is no longer required on a server, use AutoPurge remove to remove all AutoPurge capabilities.

```
/autopurge remove [channel]
```

- ðŸŸ§ Channel: Which channel should AutoPurge be removed in? This defaults to the current channel

#### AutoPurge Export

For ease of use, AutoPurge can be added to a channel via a JSON string, current AutoPurge instances can be exported and used
elsewhere.

```
/autopurge export [channel]
```

- ðŸŸ§ Channel: Which channel should have its AutoPurge settings exported? This defaults to the current channel

This allows for AutoPurge settings to be imported from a JSON string.
